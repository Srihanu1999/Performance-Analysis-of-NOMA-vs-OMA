# Performance-Analysis-of-NOMA-vs.-OMA-in-Wireless-Communication-Systems
This project simulates and compares Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) in a wireless communication system using MATLAB. The focus is on analyzing the Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) performance to evaluate the efficiency of each technique.
 ##  Features
- Simulates **QPSK modulation** over a **Rayleigh fading channel** with **AWGN noise**  
- Implements **Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) for NOMA**  
- Computes and plots **BER vs. SNR curves for both NOMA and OMA**
