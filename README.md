# Performance-Analysis-of-NOMA-vs.-OMA-in-Wireless-Communication-Systems
Here I'm comparing **NOMA (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access)** and **OMA (Orthogonal Multiple Access)** in a wireless communication system using MATLAB. The project simulates data transmission over a noisy wireless channel and analyzes **Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**. I have implemented **Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) in NOMA** to see how it improves performance. The goal is to understand which technique is better for **efficient and reliable wireless communication**. ðŸš€
